** Development

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

A browser window will be launched running from `{{name}}.main` on [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449). Auto-reloading with Figwheel is enabled, however do note that because of peculiarities with the behavior of canvas elements and some of the internal JS event hooks, manual reloading on a change may still be necessary.
